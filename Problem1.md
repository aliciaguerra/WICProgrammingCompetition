#Problem 1: Cubes in a Spherical World
A cubic number is a product of three identical numbers. For example, 8 is a cubic number because 8 = 2 * 2 * 2. 
Your task is to determine how many cubic meters exist in a given array of integers.
#Examples:
`[1,2,3,6,9,10,27] -> 2` <br>
`[8,64,729] -> 3` 
#Sample File Format
- Sample-in: One line per input. Each line contains a list of integers seperated by spaces, representing the array. 
- Sample-out: One line per output.Each line contains an integer representing the number of cubes found in the given array.

#Required Method Signature
`/*` <br>
`* Parameter(s): int[] numbers - array in which which to search for lucky cubes` <br>
`*Return: int - the number of cubes in the input array` <br>
`*/` <br>
`public static int luckOut(int[] numbers) {` <br>
`//TODO` <br>
