#Problem 3: Lonely Composite
A prime number is a number that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A composite number is a number that can be 
divisible by other numbers other than 1 and itself. 1 is neither a prime number or a composite number. A lonely number is a
composite number that has no other composite numbers adjacent to it. You are given an integer array. You must find the number 
of lonely composite numbers in the given work of art. <br>
Only positive integers will be tested. 

#Examples:
`[1, 3, 2, 8, 7, 6] -> 2` <br>
`[2, 6, 10, 3, 6] -> 1`

#Sample File Format:
- Sample-in: One line per input. Each line contains a list of integers seperated by spaces, representing the array.
- Sample-out: One line per output. Each line contains an integer that indicates the number of lonely composites in a given array.

#Required Method Signature:
`/*` <br>
`* Parameter(s): int[] numbers - an array of #'s in which to search for lonely composites (only positive #'s)` <br>
`* Return: int - the number of lonely composites in the given array` <br>
